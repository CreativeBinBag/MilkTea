[Brew Milk Tea](https://creativebinbag.github.io/MilkTea/)

Good day everyone. I whipped up this silly little project while trying to polish my JavaScript + React skills. It was certainly born out of my love for milk tea, but it was coupled with my knack for constantly messing up the brewing time. You see, although I drink tea at least twice every day, I often find myself in the kitchen staring at a pot devoid of water, with the sad remnants of scorched tea leaves (cue the horror music). I figured I needed an alarm of sorts to nudge me before disaster struck. What better solution than making a brewing time calculator (with an "alarm", tada) + recipe generator for various types of tea leaves used in milk tea?

It's a ridiculously simple project: pick your tea leaves, choose your preferred tea strength, specify the cup count, hit start, and follow the countdown timer. You'll also notice a quaint notepad-esque page popping up to guide you on making a decent cup of tea.

Two aspects of this project make me particularly happy:
1) As the timer ticks away, the teapot slowly fills with tea. I wanted it to imitate the real-life visual of tea changing from a pale to a darker color. I wanted to capture that magic here.
2) Once the brewing is over, a 30-second audio snippet of one of my favorite songs, "San Luis" by Gregory Alan Isakov starts playing. This small window of optimism is special to me because on most days, I am a pretty nihilistic individual. 

This project helped me understand the importance of state variables and hooks for improving an application's performance. State variables are special because they update their values during a re-render event, and a hook like useEffect() can handle side operations efficiently in a functional component. Although the code I wrote isn't perfect, I can see how it's more readable compared to classic class components.

I might come back to this project in the future and implement it in a more practical context. But for now, the aim is simply to create something fun and light-hearted to brighten my day and, hopefully, serve as a reminder to turn off the stove at the right time.

Cheers to happy tea times!
